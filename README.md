# NIST Pre-Pilot Evaluation Event Prediction
We participated in the 2015 Pre-Pilot Data Science Evaluation organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The primary goal of the pre-pilot evaluation is to develop and exercise the evaluation process in the context of data science. The evaluation consists of four tasks including data cleaning, data alignment, forecasting and prediction. This is the implementation of our best performing prediction system in the NIST Pre-Pilot Evaluation.
